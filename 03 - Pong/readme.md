# Pong

Hit the ball with your paddle and try and get it past your opponent.

## Version 1

The first version of this game has the basic game mechanics but is missing scoring and has very simple logic for the trajectory of the ball.

## Version 2

The second version of the game fixes a bug where the ball would be stuck on the paddle, it improves the keyboard controls as well as makes the opponent movement smoother.

The major changes in version two are the added music and sound effects as well as more realstic deflection of the ball when it hits the paddle making the gameploy more enjoyable.

The game looks very similar, though it now has a dotted line drawn down the centre.
